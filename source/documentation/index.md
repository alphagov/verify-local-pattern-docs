# Local government service toolkit

These guidance pages are for people who work in local government. They outline best practice for delivering digital services.

The service patterns have been designed collaboratively by GDS and the councils involved in the <a href="http://www.localdigitalcoalition.uk/product/extension-of-gov-uk-verify-to-local-government-pilot/">Verify Local pilots</a>. The patterns are based on <a href="https://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/2017/02/14/collaborative-user-research-for-verifylocal-discovery/">user research done in Discovery</a>, and are actively being iterated on based on research with real users in Alpha.

To feedback on these patterns, <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/verify-local-patterns/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">open an issue on Github</a>.
