# Service patterns for local government services

These guidance pages are for people who work in local government. They outline best practice for delivering digital services.

The service patterns have been designed collaboratively by GDS and the councils involved in the <a href="http://www.localdigitalcoalition.uk/product/extension-of-gov-uk-verify-to-local-government-pilot/">Verify Local pilots</a>. The patterns are in their first iteration, based on <a href="https://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/2017/02/14/collaborative-user-research-for-verifylocal-discovery/">user research done in Discovery</a>, and will be iterated once they've been tested with real users in Alpha.
